                <p>Precisely, if you come to Peru, It is a high probability that you’ll arrive first at Lima, located on the coast. There is situated the International airport named Jorge Chavez. Many visitants consider the Peruvian capital as a passing city, previous to getting to Cusco, Machu Picchu, or the eastern Amazon. That is why the Machu Travel Peru group has prepared an article with the best things to do in Lima. We hope that this is an incentive for you to dare to know this unmissable site. Do not miss one of the most popular places in Peru.</p>
                <p> Lima, also known as the Ciudad de Reyes (due to its foundation coinciding with the Three Kings month, January), is a place full of culture and tradition.Our recommendation is to visit it between December to April (Dry Season). Sunny days, clear skies, and warm and humid weather will accompany you during these months. On the opposite, from May to November (the Rainy season) you will find a Lima with cloudy skies, down fog, cold and humid weather, and small showers.
                </p>
                <p>Regarding safety, like other Capital cities, Lima has a little share of crime. Mostly located on the outskirts of the city. Therefore, always we recommend don’t stray from the city center and tourist districts such as Miraflores or Barranco, where there are more security cameras and police officers. Happily, our 20 best things to do in Lima take place within safe tourist areas, so rest assured.</p>
                <h4>1. PLAZA DE ARMAS OF LIMA</h4>
                <p>Its construction dates from 1535 when the Spanish Francisco Pizarro decided to fund the capital of a recent nation there. Many scholars affirm that the surrounding buildings had a high bill of construction, belonging to the Renaissance style. Unfortunately, these buildings were left in ruins after the earthquake of 1746. However, their later reconstructions of the baroque invoice, present a new face to the Plaza de Armas.</p>

                <h4> 2. BEST PERUVIAN GASTRONOMY TOUR</h4>

                <h4> 3.TAKE A WALK BY A CAT’S PARK </h4>
                <p>As happens with large cities, all its original inhabitants left the historic center to settle in much larger urban areas, Lima is no exception. Its inhabitants were moved to districts like Miraflores, San Isidro, and Surco. Precisely, the main square of Miraflores, called John. F. Kennedy park, is the residence of many funny cats and visiting it is one of the best things to do in Lima. These felines spend the day walking through the green areas of the park, resting under the sidewalks, on the branch of a tree, or simply walking with park visitors. They are friendly and let themselves be caressed and fed.</p>
                <p>Nowadays, there are more than 70 cats in all of Jhon. F. Kennedy park. Their origin is totally unknown. Some affirm that the Cats belonged to a near convent with rat problems and a good day, these deserted the cloister.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adress: Jose Larco Avenue 15074, Miraflores district, Lima</li>
